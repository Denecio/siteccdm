            The "Ciclo de Conversas Design + Multimédia" is a cycle of conferences held annually in the context of the Degree and Masters courses in Design and Multimedia of the Faculty of Science and Technology of the University of Coimbra. It will take place in April 2024, divided into four sessions that will take place on Wednesday afternoons in the auditorium of the Science Museum in Coimbra. The conferences are open to the general public and admission is free. This public outreach action outside the Faculty intends not only to show the work of different professionals whose work is widely recognized, but also to contribute to the dissemination of the courses, the first in this area taught at the University of Coimbra. The program consists of guests from various areas (Graphic Design, Interaction Design, Web Design, Architecture, Design Theory, Art, Illustration, etc.) spread over four sessions. In the same session, two invited entities (which may be individual or collective) from different areas are deliberately brought together.

              <h4 class="nome"> Karel Martens </h4>
              <p class="texto"> 
                Martens completed his education at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Industrial Arts (Holland) in 1961. Since then he has worked as a freelance graphic designer, specializing in typography. In addition to commissioned work, he has always made prints and three-dimensional work. Among his clients have been the publishers Van Loghum Slaterus in Arnhem in the 1960s, and the SUN (Socialistiese Uitgeverij Nijmegen) in the years 1975–81. As well as designing books and printed matter, he has designed stamps and telephone cards (for the Dutch PTT). He has also designed signs and typographic facades for a number of buildings. In 2005 he designed the glass facades of the new part of the building for the Philharmonie in Haarlem; this design was based on a music score by Louis Andriessen. Among his awards have been the H.N. Werkman Prize (1993) for the design of the architectural journal Oase, and the Dr. A.H. Heineken Prize for the Arts (1996). A monograph about his work, Karel Martens: Printed Matter, was published as part of the Heineken Prize. Mr. Martens has taught graphic design since 1977, first at the Arnhem Academy and later (1994–97) at the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht. In 1997, with Wigger Bierma, he founded the Typography Workshop within the Arnhem Academy of Art, where he shares the artistic supervision of students with Armand Mevis. Mr. Martens was appointed to the Yale faculty in 1997 and is currently senior critic in graphic design.
